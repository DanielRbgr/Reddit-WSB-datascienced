# Reddit-WSB-datascienced
This project tries to apply some data analytics and data science to Wallstreetbets subreddit during the Gamestop hype. The focus was mainly on data analytics, trying to get a hold on how the subreddit developed during late 2020 and ealry 2021 by analyzing all the posts uploaded during that time period and extracting interesting features and measurements out of them.
Finally, to see whether there are any measureable connections between the stock price and whatever is happening in the forum, a machine learning modell was set up where one can fed different input features and see how good the prediciton is. It is a rather lowkey modell, so dont expect any highly accurate predicitons (as mentioned before, the focus was on the analytics part).
Feel free to read the documentation or download the code and play with it yourself.

## What the repositorie includes
You will find everything you need to reproduce the results and data shown in the documentation. Each file should be able to run standalone if you install the packages shown at the top. In essence, the project is divided in two parts: Get the data and process it. The code for downloading should work without problems, for processing the data you most likel need to change the path files.
Feel free to change the code however you like.
